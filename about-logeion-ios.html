<p><a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu" target="_blank">Logeion</a> (literally, a place for words; in particular, <a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#λογεῖον" target="_blank">a speaker&#39;s platform</a>, or an <a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#logeum" target="_blank">archive</a>) was developed after the example of <a href="http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/" title="" target="_blank">dvlf.uchicago.edu</a>, to provide simultaneous lookup of entries in the many reference works that make up the Perseus Classical collection. Most reference works represented in this app are based on digitized texts from the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">Perseus Digital Library</a> at Tufts University. As always, we are grateful for the Perseus Project's generosity in sharing their data. None of this would be possible without their commitment to open access.</p>
<p><a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu" target="_blank">Logeion</a> was developed by Josh Goldenberg and Matt Shanahan as a web site in the summer of 2011 at The University of Chicago. This iOS app was developed by Joshua Day in order to provide similar functionality when the user is off-line, in an iOS-native environment. We gratefully acknowledge support from The College and from Web Services (IT Services) at The University of Chicago.</p>
<p>We hope you will find Logeion useful! Comments and suggestions: please use the link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDJCd2ZsUncyNmlPRWEwU2dROGM4M0E6MQ#gid=0">Report A Problem</a>. We are always interested in adding more dictionaries; please contact Helma Dik (Classics Department, University of Chicago) directly if you have dictionaries that we can use or other assistance or enhancements, as opposed to bugs and errors. </p> 
	<h2 >Quick Tips</h2>
	<p><a href="screenshotsphone" target="_blank">Consult screen shots for iPhone</a></p>
	<p><a href="screenshotsiPad.html" target="_blank">Consult screen shots for iPad</a></p><p>To search for a word start typing in the search box (in the side bar on your iPad; if you don't see it, swipe in from the left margin). As you type your third character the system should start showing you results. Should you be looking for a shorter word, tap search when you have typed the complete word. Tap on the word in the word wheel to see the entry for that word. To dismiss the side bar on the iPhone or in portrait view on the iPad, tap outside the side bar area. To go back to the side bar, swipe in from the left margin. If you have navigated to the Logeion web site or other external links, swipe sideways with four fingers to return to the app. </p>
	<p>Search for Greek using the modern Greek keyboard. You can switch through your international keyboards using the wire-frame world button to the left of the spacebar. If you have not enabled the Greek keyboard, you can add it through Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards → Add New Keyboard… → Greek. For searching Greek you can do so with or without diacritics.</p>
	<p>When search results include proper names, all uppercase words precede lowercase words in the word wheel. Proper names are often not listed in the Greek dictionaries. To find more information about Greek people and places, try the Latin transliteration as well.</p>
	<p>Attikos, the iOS app to read Greek, links to Logeion. Developers who wish to link to the Logeion app from their own apps or from web pages should use the following scheme: LogeionLookUp://wordtolookup. For Greek words, use full diacritics.</p> 
	<p>Finally, not all reference works included in Logeion on the web are also a part of this app. From any entry, you can access the web version of Logeion by tapping on red Logeion logo at the top right of your screen. This is also the easiest route to a full-text search of the dictionaries and the Greek and Latin corpus.</p> 
    <h2 >Differences between the web site and the app</h2>
    <p>For reasons of size, performance, and rights, and because there are only so many hours in a day, the web site and the app differ in a number of ways. We list the most important ones below.
    <ul><li>The web site allows entry of inflected forms because it has access to our morphology database, which is too big to include in the app. If you are trying to track down an inflected form, start by entering just a few characters.</li>
    <li>In the app, you must enter Greek using the built-in Greek keyboard of iOS. On the site, you can also use transliteration. </li>
    <li>We have agreed not to make the full text of DuCange and the Latin-Dutch dictionary available, so these cannot be included in the app. </li>
    <li>On the site, we provide example sentences from our corpus, from which users can navigate to the Perseus texts in our database; frequent authors and collocation words link to a search for the relevant lemma in an author, or for the relevant collocations in the corpus. In the app, we omit the example sentences and simply list frequent authors and collocations without links to the corpus. However, selecting a collocation word will bring up a menu, in which 'Look Up' can be used to jump to that word in Logeion. Note that in this same menu, 'Speak' is a built-in feature of iOS; words will be pronounced in a language that iOS knows, which is neither Latin nor ancient Greek.   </li></ul></p>
    <h2 >Frequency Data</h2>
    <p>The frequency and collocation data included in this app were collated at The University of Chicago.</p>
    <p>The frequency graph is meant to be nothing more than a visual aid. It makes evident that a word is used frequently or otherwise by showing the corresponding bar in red. The data is preprocessed, and grouped by frequency in count. Each group spans a range of about 150 words. That is, if the bar at the far left appears red then the word in question is one of the top 150 most frequently used words.</p>
    <p>When the citation forms for dictionary entries are identical (e.g., χράω 'attack' and χράω 'pronounce an oracle'), these uses are distinguished in Logeion and in our morphological database with index numbers (e.g., χράω and χράω2). In principle, these numbers should agree with the ordering in the major dictionaries, but the short definitions given at the opening of each entry should make the distinctions clear. This is important to know in the case of frequency data, since we aim to display the frequencies and collocations for the more frequent word. However, we will not always be successful in pulling this off, and our use of automated tagging means that certain lookalikes gain spurious ranking cred. Therefore, do proceed with caution when using these data. Logeion on the web allows you to follow up with your own corpus searches to double-check our data. Do report egregious errors; we try to address these.

        <li> BWL covers 85% of the vocabulary in Caesar, Cicero (oratory and philosophical works), Sallust, Livy, Seneca (letters), Tacitus, Catullus, Vergil, Horace (Odes), and Ovid, except where such words only rise to high frequency in a single one of these authors.</li>
        <li> Prepared with the help of LASLA in Liège to cater to Dutch secondary schools in the 1970s, this text is now out of print.
