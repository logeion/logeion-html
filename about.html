<ul> 
<li><a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu" target="_blank">Logeion</a> (literally, a place for words; in particular, <a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#λογεῖον" target="_blank">a speaker's platform</a>, or an <a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#logeum" target="_blank">archive</a>) was developed after the example of <a href="http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/" title="" target="_blank">dvlf.uchicago.edu</a>, to provide simultaneous lookup of entries in the many reference works that make up the Perseus Classical collection. As always, we are grateful for the Perseus Project's generosity in sharing their data. None of this would be possible without their commitment to open access. To improve the chronological range for which the dictionaries are useful, we have added DuCange (see below), and to enhance this site as both a research and a pedagogical tool, we add information based on corpus data in the right side bar, as well as references to chapters in standard textbooks. More such 'widgets' will be added over time, along with, we hope, still more dictionaries.<br> </li></p><p style="padding-top:0px; padding-right:72px; text-align:justify;"> </li>
<li><b>Update August 2014: </b>In addition to the usual editing of existing dictionaries and morphology (keep reporting typos to us, please!), we are delighted to add a first author-specific lexicon on the Latin side, thanks to efforts at Dickinson College. Users will now encounter Frieze-Dennison's lexicon to Vergil's Aeneid for relevant entries. Many thanks to Christopher Francese and the DCC 'crew'! On another note, Logeion and the Logeion app got a mention in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/books/review/gateways-to-the-classical-world.html?ref=books&_r=0">New York Times</a>, which we are thrilled about. We are, as always, grateful to Josh, Matt & Josh for developing this site and the app, and to the College of the University of Chicago for its support and its 'ambidextrous' undergrads, who know their way around Python and XML as well as around Greek and Latin.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Update December 2013:
We are delighted to announce that we are adding the premier dictionary for Ancient Greek, the <a href="http://dge.cchs.csic.es/">Diccionario Griego-Español (DGE)</a>, to Logeion. Both for entries from DGE and from DuCange, we will include a link to these dictionaries' home sites for every entry we display. As we work on displaying these entries better, we recommend (also) visiting the home sites, which look positively elegant. This update also brings the Latin-Dutch dictionary, LaNe, up to date with the printed 6th edition, which will be coming out soon. <br><br>
</li>
<li>Update October 2013:
Logeion is now available as an <a href="about-logeion-ios.html">app for iOS</a>, so that you can consult it even without a working internet connection. Find the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/logeion/id727860177?mt=8">Logeion app</a> in Apple's app store.<br><br></li>
<li>Update January 2012: 
We have now added a Latin-Dutch dictionary to the collection: The <i>Woordenboek Latijn/Nederlands.</i> One notable feature of this dictionary, for those who do not speak Dutch, is that a lot of attention has been paid to ensure accuracy of vowel length for the lexical entries. For further information see below. <br><br> </li>

</ul>
<h2 style="font-size:bigger; font-family:'Gill sans','Trebuchet MS',Helvetica,Tahoma,sans-serif;">Using ΛΟΓΕΙΟΝ</h2> 
<ul> 
<li style="padding-top:0px; padding-right:72px; text-align:justify;">
<li>Learning to use Logeion to look up words should be straightforward. Start typing in (the first few letters of) the headword (or lemma) for the entry (transliteration is an option for Greek words) and the word wheel will spin to what we hope will be the right destination. Enter a minimum of three characters, and the system will attempt to suggest entries in the neighborhood.  <br><br>
</li>
<li>Details, details: When you are typing in a word, Logeion will consult its database and suggest Greek or Latin lookalikes. If you are typing in transliterated Greek, pick the suggested Greek word when it appears in the drop down menu. If you simply hit enter (or click on the 'Go' button) after typing 'logos', the system will take your input literally, and direct you to the entry for 'logos' in the Latin dictionaries. Note that the system is a rather poor student of the Greek alphabet - words in the suggestion list will not quite show up in the order you expect.  <br><br>
</li>
<li>If you are trying to determine the right dictionary entry for an inflected word, you have two options. Simply start typing the first few characters, and Logeion might already direct you correctly. But when things get more complicated, you can type in the complete word (for Greek, this requires full diacritics). <br><br>
</li>
<li>If the word occurs as an inflected word in our database, Logeion will suggest a lemma or lemmas for it. You can hover over the lemma to see its choice of parses. Double-clicking on words within the dictionary entries and example sentences will allow you to go to the entry for that word - provided that the database has the right parse, of course, or that by happenstance, it lands you in the right position in the alphabet. <br><br>
</li>
<li><b>Linking to Logeion quickly in the Chrome browser:</b> By control-clicking the Address Bar, you will see the possibility to "Edit search engines". Add your own Logeion search engine, by entering into the three boxes, Logeion, l, http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#%s respectively. Next time you want to look up a word from anywhere on a web page or other document, copy it, and in your browser, hit command-L, l and a space. The Address bar will now say "Search Logeion". Paste in your word and hit Enter, and you will get Logeion's attempt at a (parse and a) dictionary entry, without having to have typed out our URL. Those who type in Greek a lot may also want to add Logeion, λ, .. for an identical shortcut so that the same quick trick works without having to change your keyboard. <br><br>
</li>
</p><p style="padding-top:0px; padding-right:72px; text-align:justify;"> </li></ul>
<h2 style="font-size:bigger; font-family:'Gill sans','Trebuchet MS',Helvetica,Tahoma,sans-serif;">Beyond the dictionaries</h2> 
<ul> 
<li style="padding-top:0px; padding-right:72px; text-align:justify;">
<li>For the most frequent words, we give you a sense of their frequency ranking in the corpus, as a way for students and teachers of the languages to prioritize their activity, or in general, to judge whether a given word in a text one is reading is in fact a frequent expression or a rare bird. To further assist in these activities, we list collocations and aim, depending of course on the texts words are attested in, to provide examples of the word's use in standard prose, e.g., Lysias for Greek and Caesar and Cicero for Latin. These examples can be found following the major dictionaries, but before the reference works. Clicking on the author and work will lead you to a search in Perseus under PhiloLogic for the lemma. Clicking on the collocations will lead you to a search for the particular collocation; clicking on a frequent author will bring you to a search for the lemma in that author's corpus. 
<br><br>
</li>
<li>The frequency and collocation data included in this app were collated at The University of Chicago. When the citation forms for dictionary entries are identical (e.g., χράω 'attack' and χράω 'pronounce an oracle'), these uses are distinguished in Logeion and in our morphological database with index numbers (e.g., χράω and χράω2). In principle, these numbers should agree with the ordering in the major dictionaries, but the short definitions given at the opening of each entry should make the distinctions clear. This is important to know in the case of frequency data, since we aim to display the frequencies and collocations for the more frequent word. However, we will not always be successful in pulling this off, and our use of automated tagging means that certain lookalikes gain spurious ranking cred. Therefore, do proceed with caution when using these data. Logeion on the web allows you to follow up with your own corpus searches to double-check our data. Do report egregious errors; we try to address these.<br><br> </li>
<li>For full-text searches of the dictionaries (where in LSJ do we find reference to Xenophon's Anabasis, where is λόγος used in any entry, not just in the entry for λόγος), use the links in the list of sources below. Full-text search is only possible for the reference works that are fully in the public domain. Below, the home page will be specified for projects that have a presence online, which may include many further options for searching.<br><br></li>
